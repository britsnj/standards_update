# standards_update
Python project to search for construction standards in a word document and update it automatically

18/07/2021
Initial idea is to search through a word document and create a list / tuple / dict with the standards present in the document. Then it should reference a library file (still to be compiled. Consider web scraping???) and update the standards based on country / continent the project is located in.
